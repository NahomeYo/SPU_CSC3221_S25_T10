My task was creating a script that sent HTTP requests to our assigned API, which I refer to as the base URL, based on user input. I added a click event on the "send-btn," and when triggered, it constructs the full URL being requested by combining the base URL, the endpoint (user input), and the query parameters (also user input). The script then uses fetch() to send a request based on the selected HTTP method. After writing this script, I linked the JavaScript sheet to our HTML page using the <script> tag after the body, allowing the browser to load our external script.

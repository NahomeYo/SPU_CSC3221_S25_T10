  ## Created a new file called taskServer.js to build the backend for the Task Manager project.
    - Used Express to set up a basic web server.
    - Connected to MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose to store and manage task data.
    - Defined basic routes for CRUD operations:
    - GET /tasks – to read all tasks.
    - POST /tasks – to create a new task.
    - PUT /tasks/:id – to update a task using its ID only.
    - DELETE /tasks/:id – to delete a task by ID only.

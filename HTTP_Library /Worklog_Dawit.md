my task was CSS styling and UI improvement, I created the styles.css for consistent visual styling, ensuring a friendly layout for input also improved readability of the JASON response with syntax-like format.

JavaScript error handling also was part of my job detecting any form of API errors and sending out message to users in a 404,500 and ect style. I also did user-friendly suggestions like comments on how ask for users info

In order to exceed expectation, I developed the toggle drop-down menu for the methods making a user-friendly and as well as hiding that JASON input for the GET and DELETE section making the UI more appealing making the user only see relevant field in what they choose.

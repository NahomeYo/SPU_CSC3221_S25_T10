Built a Node.js/Express server (server.js) to manage user data.
 - Made the code simple and easy to read
 - Got auto-incrementing IDs working perfectly
 - Fixed the JSON formatting (ID now shows first)
 - Added clear error messages for missing users


Challenges I Faced:
 - Had to debug CORS issues between frontend/backend
 - Solved the "ID appearing last in JSON" problem
 - Made DELETE and PATCH routes work reliably(was not working becuase of diffrent localhost)

How I Solved Them:
 - Used middleware to format responses 
 - Added proper CORS settings for local development
 - Tested each endpoint step-by-step and connect host

Built a Node.js/Express server (server.js) to manage user data.
 - Made the code simple and easy to read
 - Got auto-incrementing IDs working perfectly
 - Fixed the JSON formatting (ID now shows first)
 - Added clear error messages for missing users


Challenges I Faced:
ğŸ”§ Had to debug CORS issues between frontend/backend
ğŸ”§ Solved the "ID appearing last in JSON" problem
ğŸ”§ Made DELETE and PATCH routes work reliably

How I Solved Them:
ğŸ”¨ Used middleware to format responses consistently
ğŸ”¨ Added proper CORS settings for local development
ğŸ”¨ Tested each endpoint step-by-step
